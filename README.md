# Project: Machine Learning and Statistics
Jupyter Notebooks explaining the concepts of T-Test and how to perform Linear Regression using Scipy

## Setup/Installation Requirements
To run this project locally you are going to need Python(and its packages: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn and MatplotLib) and Jupyter Notebook as well. You can gey both of Python and Jupyter by downloading [Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
You may need to install/update some of the Python's packages.

You can use the code below to install/update your packages:
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install scipy
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## What to expect

**T-test notebook**

T-test applied on the weight data from 90 participants before and after they underwent a diet program in order to verify if the diet program was effective or not on reducing the participants weights.

That was done by performing a paired sample t-test on the participants weights before and after the diet to check if the variation was statistical relevant and was a result of the diet or not.

The t-test was performed using both Scipy.stats module and a mathematical approach.
